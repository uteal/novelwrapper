// select - Lets the player choose an answer from the options given. To be used with "await".
// call   - Calls a scene as a subscene. An example will be given below. To be used with "await".
// print  - Allows you to type text without specifying the speaker. To be used with "await".
// clear  - Force hide currently visible character and text. For a short pause can be used with "await".
// sleep  - Explicitly pauses the execution flow, gets time in milliseconds. To be used with "await".
// save   - Saves the current game state immediately. Only use if you know what you're doing.
// log    - Alias for console.log that will be silent when not in development mode, and also unwraps $ for cleaner view.
// ext    - An object with your custom data, as given at the initialization step.

    // about "tagged templates" in your spare time. For now, just know that the engine can make use of it.

    // 1) await Raven `foo` `bar`

    // 5) await Raven 'foo' 'bar'  // This is a syntax error: only strings in backticks can call a function without parentheses.

    // I will use the first notation as the most concise and clean. But the second method is robust and error-proof.
    // Actually, it may be safer not to use semicolons at the end of lines unless necessary, to avoid accidentally
    // splitting parentheses-less calls. Again: if you feel unsure, the second notation is perfectly fine.
